# Symetry-and-strategy

Will strategists survive the machines?
At its core, strategy in international relations and defense lies in the ability to anticipate the actions of an adversary (or partner). By its very nature, this game of anticipation is asymmetrical and sensitive to unforeseen events. Game theory allows us to symmetrize these dynamics by establishing a mathematical framework within which interactions can be modeled. We make it studyable, malleable and duplicable. It becomes a genuine mathematical object.

It clarifies the assumptions on which strategic decisions are based. By precisely defining the parameters of the game, we force a reflection on the motivations, resources and constraints of the players. The transition to mathematics provides analytical tools for identifying points of convergence or divergence in strategic behavior. This transforms a qualitative problem into a quantifiable one.
